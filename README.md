SEMANTIC WEB ANNOTATION

Abstract

The Semantic Web Annotation Project is a machine learning-based application designed to analyze news articles and predict their categories, sentiment, or authenticity. With the increasing volume of online news, it has become crucial to develop AI-driven tools that help users filter and understand news efficiently.

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to classify and predict news trends. It is built using Python, with Flask for the backend, and a simple UI for user interaction.

Features


✅ Predicts the category or sentiment of a news article
✅ Uses machine learning for accurate predictions
✅ Simple and user-friendly interface
✅ Scalable and easy to customize
